## About the Video Course
Framework Manager, part of the IBM Cognos Business Intelligence suite, allows users to model data to facilitate report development and delivery. Framework Manager acts as the middleware between the database and report-writing tools such as Workspace Advanced and Report Studio. While Framework Manager can appear to be very technical and hard to understand, at its core, it's a very simple application that just requires some basic knowledge of SQL and the end reporting goals of the organization.

In this series, you'll learn how to navigate and master the components of a model or package. (Knowing your way around is crucial to understanding the application.) Then you'll design, build, deploy, and test your models. Finally, you'll apply security to the model; otherwise, users would have open access to all tables and fields published in it.

The goal of this course is to make Framework Manager easy and fast to learn. While becoming an expert takes time, this series is a great springboard into further developing or improving models that may exist in your organization.
